    <p>Dear Pathways Users,</p>
    <p>You're seeing this error because Cloudflare, our DNS provider, is unable to resolve our usual web address (https://pathwaysbc.ca/) to the address that our hosting service provides us with (https://pathwaysbc.herokuapp.com).</p>
    <p>In order to continue using pathways, simply access the site directly at <a href="https://pathwaysbc.herokuapp.com">https://pathwaysbc.herokuapp.com</a>.</p>
    <p>We apologize for this inconvenience, and invite you to visit our <a href="http://status.pathwaysbc.ca/">status page</a> if you would like to learn more about this issue.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
